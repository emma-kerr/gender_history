1,1,,?? Noise or History of the Book,Noise,Publication,Publication,Noise,publication,slightly disagree. There are certainly history of the book aspects (as well as historiography) to this topic but I think it’s mostly a noise topic related to books. I don’t see a reason why History of the Book would have peaked in 1950 and declined since then as Topic 1 has.,"histori, book, work, studi, publish, historian, first, histor, year, volum, one, write, period, articl, edit, scholar, author, use, interest, sourc","volum, book, publish, biographi, edit, chapter, page, biograph, monograph, reader, topic, manuscript, written, scholar, historian, articl, titl, prefac, translat, literari"
